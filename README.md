My webpack bundle for frontend develop with native JS
## How to use gulp for fonts
- Download your fonts, only .ttf format.
- Run gulp.
````
gulp
````
- Go to fonts.scss.
- First title is font-name, change it on the name without weight:
<p>OpenSans-Regular ==> OpenSans</p>

- Second title is filename, don't change it.
- Change weight numbers correctly:

100: Thin; 

200: Extra Light (Ultra Light);

300: Light;

400: Normal;

500: Medium;

600: Semi Bold (Demi Bold);

700: Bold;

800: Extra Bold (Ultra Bold);

900: Black (Heavy).

*Now you have completed font-face for every font in your project:)*
